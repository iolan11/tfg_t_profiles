Code from the TFG - Temperature profiles to characterise groundwater flux in the presence of a fault. Iolanda Campos June 21.

Vertical  steady  flow  and  horizontal  flow  solutions  are  presented  and  analyzed  to explain  fault-controlled  geothermal  anomalies.   These  analysis  are  applied  to  data  sets of temperature with depth profiles, that are not included.
